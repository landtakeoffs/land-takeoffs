# Civil Engineering App

## Source Code
Code consolidated from Perplexity + ChatGPT conversations.

## What We Have
- `estimate_workbook.py` — Python script that generates a full construction bid estimate Excel workbook (TSC Liberty Bid)
  - Sections: Earthwork, Erosion Control, Storm Drainage, Water, Sanitary Sewer, Paving & Concrete, Striping & Signage, Fencing & Misc
  - Uses pandas + xlsxwriter to generate .xlsx
  - Parametric assumptions for quantities
  - Auto-calculates line totals and grand total

## TODO
- Consolidate remaining code from Perplexity conversations
- Get ChatGPT conversation code (need login access or manual export)
- Organize into proper app structure
- Define what the final product should look like (CLI tool? Web app? Both?)
